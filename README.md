## DESCRIPTION

Sparse Array was simply an expirement in implementing
an Array class on top of Hash. In so doing allowing for
very efficent *sparse arrays* --arrays with many empty
entries.

Ruby's Array implementation has improved a great deal
and is now much more efficient at handling sparse
arrays, so this library it nothing more than a neovelty
or learning aid, at this point.

An side note, this library is the first your humble author
ever used TDD to produce.

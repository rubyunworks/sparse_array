# Sparse Array

## DESCRIPTION

Sparse Array was simply an experiment in implementing
an Array class on top of Hash. In so doing allowing for
very efficient *sparse arrays* --arrays with many empty
entries.

Ruby's Array implementation has improved a great deal
and is now much more efficient at handling sparse
arrays, so this library it nothing more than a novelty
or learning aid, at this point.

Also, a bit of trivia: This library is the first your humble author
ever used TDD to produce.
